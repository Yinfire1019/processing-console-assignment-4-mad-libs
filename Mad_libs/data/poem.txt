Rain
I <verb> my eyes
And <verb> up at the <noun>,
And it <verb> in my head
And <verb> into my brain,
And all that I <verb> as I <verb> in my <noun>
Is the slishity-slosh of the <noun> in my head.

I step very <adjective>,
I <verb> very <adjective>,
I can't do a handstand--
I might overflow,
So <verb> the wild crazy thing I just <verb>--
I'm just not the same since there's <noun> in my head.
