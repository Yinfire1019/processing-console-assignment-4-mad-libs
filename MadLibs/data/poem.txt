I <verb> my <noun>
And <verb> up at the <noun>,
And it <verb> in my <noun>
And <verb> into my <noun>,
And all that I <verb> as I <verb> in my <noun>
Is the slishity-slosh of the <noun> in my <noun>.

I step very <adjective>,
I <verb> very <adjective>,

I might overflow,
So <verb> the wild crazy thing I just <verb>--
I'm just not the same since there's <noun> in my <noun>
